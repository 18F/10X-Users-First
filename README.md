# 10X-Users-First

## Welcome

_The Discovery phase of this project (phase 2) has ended and we are currently awaiting a decision from TTS leadership on whether or not this project will proceed with phase 3 funding._

This is the repository for the 10X project Users First, a government-wide user centered design support project. It's a collaborative workspace for the team that offers stakeholders and other interested parties information about the project's goals and progress as we work towards improving user-centered design across federal agencies.
